#+TITLE: CL interface to Secret Service API

This is a partial interface to the Secret Service API in Common Lisp. Secret service is an API to store keys and passwords in a dedicated service; both Gnome and KDE provide such service (gnome-keyring).

It allows one to offload caring about how to safely store passwords and keys for CL projects to someone else.

Simple usage:
#+begin_src lisp
  (find-the-secret '(("machine" "example.com")))
#+end_src

would list secrets with parameter machine having provided value. The output is a list/structure secret; use  ~STRINGIFY-SECRET~ to it this list to the proper password.

See [[./test.lisp][test cases]] for more on creating and searching secrets.

BUGS/TODOS:
- Locking/unlocking
- Implement prompts.
- probably naming should be improved and code cleaned up.
- encryption on fly in dbus (non-plain sessions)
