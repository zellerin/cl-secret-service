#+TITLE: CL interface to Secret Service API

This is a partial interface to the Secret Service API in Common Lisp. Secret service is an API to store keys and passwords in a dedicated service; both Gnome and KDE provide such service (gnome-keyring).

It allows one to offload caring about how to safely store passwords and keys for CL projects to someone else.

Simple usage:
#+begin_src lisp
  (find-the-secret '(("machine" "example.com")))
#+end_src

would return password for the secret with parameter machine having provided value, if there is only one, prompting for password if necessary.

See [[./test.lisp][test cases]] for more detail on creating and searching secrets and work with collections.

See [[https://doc.zellerin.cz/secret-service/][documentation]].

BUGS/TODOS:
- encryption on fly in dbus (non-plain sessions)
- complete the few missing APIs (collections mostly)
- It would be better to wait for the unlocking result than to poll.
